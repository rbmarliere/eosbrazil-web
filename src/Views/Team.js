                                    As I'm writing this, my great nation is yet in another crisis. Truck drivers are on strike across our whole territory for days, resulting in a sharp collapse. Gas stations without any, schools closed, farms with starving animals, stores with no food, hospitals with no medicine, wild dumps on the stock market and an even weaker fiat currency. We were a colony from 1500 to 1822, an empire until 1889 and a republic since then, coming to life after a coup. Since then, we had at least seven others (some unsuccessful) while the most known was the military coup of 1964 which gave birth to a very sad part of our history marked by censorship and violence. The regime ended in 1984 with redemocratization and we impeached two of the six presidents elected since then. No, my friend, Brazil is not for amateurs. But it doesn't require much thought to conclude that in essence the central problem is governance. This is exactly what made me curious about EOS at the first place.

                                    I discovered EOS a week after the May 2017 consensus presentation given by Dan, receiving the link of his video by accident on some random stream chat box. I joined the only EOS group on Telegram with about 1600 users by the time we were anxious for their white paper to be released. It turned into a huge part of my life and I spent many hours studying EOS everyday ever since, being emerged in this beautiful community. Thankfully I didn’t come across on any misinformation regarding Dan on those initial weeks of research and saw the value of EOS very early. All it took for me to click was to use Steem and BitShares (to finally learn what on Earth was “margin trading”) once. Even though I knew vaguely about Bitcoin before, I actually first bought some on January 2017 and as you see, I had no time to become attached to it, transforming myself into a stubborn EOS “maximalist” going all in on the first period of the token sale.

                                    Having participated in the first community superheroes testnet and a few others that came later, I have learned a lot. Although producing blocks by itself is rather simple, it should be done by good actors that have the best interest of the community as top priority. I firmly believe that developing nations will play a huge role on the sharing economy framework being built, as China has masterfully demonstrated. It would be the greatest honor of my life to serve the EOS community as a Block Producer, while helping funding strategic resources around Brazil and South America to further dissiminate the new paradigm that EOS is giving birth to.

                                    Before undertaking this enterprise, most of my adult career had been spent working a boring accounting job for the United States government (DoD FM certified) but I find this career path far more exciting and promising! Before this I was also part of the Japanese computer game preservation community as a hobby (dumping floppy disks, scanning instruction manuals, and so on).

                                    With only 2 people to our team so far, ours is very much a garage door operation. I’m inspired by one of my favorite crypto exchanges, Bitstamp, which started out in much the same way. Now the block producing task itself is deceptively simple, however we must always consider the adversarial environment of the blockchain, and consider people with experience in scaling and security operations. That said, we have several potential employees in mind, and I encourage any enterprising Brazilian nerds interested in joining our team to get in touch with Ricardo.

                                    I’d like to point out, the problem is not so much in finding skilled workers, but finding skilled workers who have the foresight to believe in a future which is paved by EOS and the blockchain. It’s hard to convince people of the benefits of such a disruptive technology, but I’m sure they will see things our way in due time).

                                    Having extensive familiarity with Japan and Japanese culture, it was originally my intention to serve as a proxy representative for the Japanese community. This is why I created this informational <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAnoy9gpdTA" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">video in Japanese</a> (10,000+ views on nicovideo).  However due to life getting in the way it became more and more difficult to achieve this task. I’m happy to say that <a href="http://www.eosjapan.org" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">JEDA</a> seems to have stepped into the Japanese role quite nicely and would like to extend my personal recommendation to nominate them as a fellow BP.

                                    This has been a learning experience for me. I have gone from thinking “This shit is never going to work” to “Just how far can we take this?” At this point we’ve done just about all we can do, the rest is up to you guys, so stake those tokens and vote! It is hard to anticipate what lies in store in the coming weeks and months leading up to and beyond the EOS launch, but I’m sure this will be an enriching experience for all of us.
